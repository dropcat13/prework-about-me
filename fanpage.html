        <h2>Bio</h2>

          <p>System of a Down is an Armenian-American heavy metal band from Glendale, California. They formed in 1994 and have 5 albums; the band currently consists of Serj Tankian (lead vocals, keyboards), Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals) and John Dolmayan (drums).</p>
          <p>Although they are still together they have not produced an album since 2005. Some would say they knew that they couldn't surpass the double album of 'Mezmerize' and 'Hypnotize' and so haven't even tried!</p>
