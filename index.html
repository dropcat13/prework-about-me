      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I was an elementary school music teacher in London, but when the opportunity of moving to the USA happened I thought I would try something new instead of applying for a teaching licence here!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Norwich, UK</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Reading, doing puzzles and Irish dancing</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something quiet where I get to think</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Raleigh, NC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Different family members have taught me a bit of java/python/css/html and I enjoyed learning it. I love puzzles and it seemed I might be able to get a job where I just solve puzzles all day... why wouldn't I take that chance!</p>
